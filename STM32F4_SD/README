To run this example on a STM32F407 microcontroller:

1) connect PA2 (USART TX pin) to a UART-USB converter and open a 
serial port terminal (for example, GTK Term). Params: 115200 8n1.

2) Connect SD Card:
   * PA5 = SCK
   * PA6 = MISO
   * PA7 = MOSI
   * PA4 = SS
   
3) Put formatted SDSC or SDHC card into slot with a file called
"hello.txt".
